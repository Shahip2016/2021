Keep in mind these ideas are open to the public and not regulated.

## Submitting Projects
Once finished, simply send iquhack@mit.edu a zip file of your project. We will upload to iQuHACK's GitHub organization. If you would like to continue development on the project later, we ask that you fork the version we create.

## Resources
### Getting Started
We have seen some issues using python 3.8, so we recommend using **Python 3.7**.
For example, if you want your environment named `iQuHACK`:
```
conda create -n iQuHACK python=3.7
pip install qiskit
```
To load this environment: `conda activate iQuHACK`.

If `conda` cannot be found (and you are on a unix-like system), you most likely have *not* initialized it during installing.
You can do this by running the init script in the installation directory:
```
source <path to conda>/bin/activate
conda init zsh
```
Then you should be good to go. MacOS Catalina now uses `zsh` shell instead of `bash`, but put your appropriate shell name there.
